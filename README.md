# snRNAseq

These purpose of these workflows is to analyze single-nucleus RNA seq data of human and mouse muscle in healthy and disease model samples and determine which muscle celltypes express the inflammatory marker TLR7. Data sets are first filtered by % Mitochonrial DNA, read and feature counts per cell. Healthy and control group data is then  integrated and clustered based on expression profiles. Clusters are then characterized by cell type using canonical gene markers. Once celltypes are characterized, markers of interest are interrogated.
